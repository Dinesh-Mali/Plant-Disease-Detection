# Plant-Disease-Detection
This app detects plant diseases using deep learning TensorFlow and Keras.

In this project we will create a Convolutional Neural Network which will be able to predict whether a plant is suffering from a disease. 
We will use different layers and other hyperparameters for building, training and testing this classifictaion model.We will be using tensorflow and keras for this project.

This model is highly beneficial as it can be used by different agricultural firms and farmers to increase their yield and stop wastage of crops due to disease.
